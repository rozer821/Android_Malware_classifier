# Android_Malware_classifier
This project was aimed at raising awareness about Android malwares and the staggering rate at which malwares are distributed. Lack of security patches and Android updates for many devices has made them vulnerable to exploits and while the latest updates may be unavailable, researchers and companies can develop tools to protect devices from malwares.
	
The ever-evolving security landscape enables malicious applications to enter the Android ecosystem through the Google Play Store. It is important to protect devices against such malicious applications and we propose a machine learning solution to this problem.

Features we used in the research are numerous, however, it is unreasonable to say it is enough. Attackers are improving their strategy as well. Retraining the model and incorporating new features is the best way to continuously detect malicious applications.

It is important to observe the application behavior better in order to understand its true intentions. Using state-of-the-art algorithms and capturing more data points may go a long way in protect our devices.
